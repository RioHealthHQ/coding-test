# Coding Test for Node.Js / Full-stack Developer

As a NodeJS developer in your company, you have been assigned a task to create a simple HTTP web server using only the HTTP core module.
 
Each project is a JSON entry with the following keys:
	id: The unique ID of the project.
	name: The name of the project.
 
Note: A file with an array of projects, data-store.js, is present in the root of the project. Import the data from this file.

```
// index.js

var projects = require('./data-store');

// For GET requests, send the data from the projects array. 


// Write your server logic here
```
